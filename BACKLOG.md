# Sipdeck — backlog

Ordered by priority. Work top-down; each item is meant to be finishable in one focused
agent session. Story/AC references point into PRODUCT.md.

## v1 (the cut line is explicit below)

Items 1–12 ✅ done 2026-07-19 (see HANDOFF.md "Current state"). Next up: item 13.

1. ✅ **Scaffold** — `index.html` (inline the contents of `design/tokens.css` into
   `<style>`, inline `design/wordmark.svg` in the header), `app.js` (pure functions on
   top, exported for test), hash views `#/` deck, `#/favoriter`, `#/skafferi`,
   `#/installningar`; state load/save to localStorage key `sipdeck` (blob shape in
   PRODUCT.md). Mobile-first bottom nav, recept/Årshjul conventions. Visual identity is
   final (`design/README.md`) — use it, don't reinvent tokens or motion curves.
2. ✅ **Data schema + validator + first 10 drinks** — `drinks.json` per PRODUCT.md schema;
   validator in `test.js` (unique ids, every ingredient id resolvable, `essential`
   explicit, `ml` xor `qty`+`unit`, method en+sv). 10 well-known IBA drinks as seed.
3. ✅ **Unit engine** — pure functions: linear scaling, cl/ml/oz conversion, bar rounding
   (oz ¼ with vulgar fractions, cl 0,5, ml 5), sv/en number formatting, non-convertible
   units passthrough. Full `test.js` coverage. (B2, B3, F1 formatting)
4. ✅ **Deck + swipe physics + flip** — card stack, pointer-event drag, thresholds,
   spring-back, left = requeue, right = save, tap-flip with recipe back, serving stepper
   + unit toggle on the back. Committed swipes promote the existing live cards with the
   list motion curve; the deck view is not re-rendered between cards. Native image drag
   and text selection are suppressed; Arrow Left/Right use the same live swipe path. (Epic A, B)
5. ✅ **Favorites view** — compact rows with real art, continuous illustrated recipe
   detail, transient ingredient checkmarks, readable clipboard copy, un-favorite and a
   history-aware detail route whose Back action returns to the favorite list. (C1)
6. ✅ **Filters** — `bar` toggle + base-spirit select, deck rebuild + reshuffle, match count,
   empty state. (D1, D2)
7. ✅ **Pantry + "what can I make"** — grouped checklist, essential-subset match, combinable
   with filters. (E1, E2)
8. ✅ **i18n** — EN/SV string table, language toggle, browser-language default, sv typography
   rules enforced in one format layer. Settings persists `settings.lang`; navigation,
   taxonomy labels, controls and accessibility labels all route through `t()`. (F1)
9. ✅ **Image pipeline + placeholders** — frozen `gpt-image-2` reference workflow in
   HANDOFF.md, exact 640×800 WebP outputs at 11–58 kB, complete id coverage and lazy
   loading for the top four cards. Resilient inline SVG silhouettes are keyed by the
   seed's `coupe`, `highball`, `rocks` and `martini` glass values. (G1)
10. ✅ **Full drink seed** — 92 reviewed recipes and 123 normalized ingredients, with EN/SV
    methods, reviewed `bar` flags and direct published sources. All 92 ids have curated
    source illustrations and exact 640×800 production WebPs at ≤ 80 kB. The original 26
    sources and production files, plus the preexisting Manhattan source, were preserved.
11. ✅ **PWA manifest + icons** — relative paths, standalone. Export PNGs from
    `design/icon.svg` (192/512/apple-touch/maskable, on `#FBF7EF` except maskable which
    is full-bleed) and from `design/favicon.svg` (16/32) — see `design/README.md` for
    which file backs which size; don't rescale `icon.svg` down to 48/16. (H1)
12. ✅ **Spinning wheel + artwork pipeline** — a starting-page mini-wheel opens the
    localized full-screen `#/hjul` order chooser. Five visit-local drunkenness levels build
    exactly 12 visible sectors with tested contents/weights; the highest level shows seven
    water sectors and always lands on water. Includes exact landing geometry, re-spin/New
    wheel behavior, sound/mute, ticking, one landing haptic, reduced-motion handling,
    repeat safety copy and 13 optimized illustrations with reusable local masters. (J1)
13. ✅ **Strict normal-bar audit** (done 2026-07-19, see BAR-AUDIT.md: 37 stay `bar: true`,
    20 flipped, exact allowlist under regression) — research the reliably stocked baseline at representative
    ordinary, non-specialist bars, then reassess every drink currently marked `bar: true`.
    Review all essential ingredients drink by drink; IBA status and cocktail-bar availability
    are not sufficient. If a normal bar is unlikely to stock or routinely prep even one
    required spirit, liqueur, fortified wine, bitters, syrup, purée, juice, herb or other
    ingredient, set the drink to `bar: false`. Record a concise decision and blocking
    ingredient(s) for every reviewed drink, add regression coverage for the final allowlist,
    and do not change recipes, ingredients or the 92-drink seed. (D1)
14. ✅ **Performance pass + deploy** (done 2026-07-19) — static budgets, local HTTP smoke and
    Cloudflare Pages upload, plus the throttled-phone trace and live mobile smoke via
    Playwright CDP against both production origins: cold 4G load 1,8 s / LCP 1,9 s
    (budget < 2,5 s), repeat 0,3–0,4 s (budget < 1 s), full interaction/wheel/console pass
    green. Details in HANDOFF.md "v1 close-out". **v1 cut is closed.**

——————————— **v1 CUT — everything below ships after v1 is live** ———————————

## v1.1 — closed 2026-07-20 (all three items done)

15. ✅ **Accounts + sync** (done 2026-07-20) — Firebase project `sipdeck` + Cloudflare Worker
    `sipdeck-api` + D1 `users(id, firebase_uid UNIQUE, state)`, `GET/PUT /state` +
    `DELETE /account`, JWT verification lifted nearly verbatim from recept's worker,
    debounced (800 ms) whole-blob PUT, server-wins-on-load, logged-out untouched.
    Google Sign-In only (email/password skipped as YAGNI for a "Patrik + friends" v1.1 —
    the locked decision said "email+password and/or Google", either satisfies it).
16. ✅ **Deep links** (done 2026-07-20) — `#/drink/<id>` opens the continuous illustrated
    detail directly (reuses the favorite-detail view), with a Save/Remove favorite toggle
    and a Back that returns to the deck (not the favorites list) when reached this way.
17. ✅ **Security review of accounts + sync** (done 2026-07-20) — `security-review` skill run
    plus an independent sub-agent cross-check against `worker.js` (JWT verify, D1 access,
    `/account` deletion) and `app.js`'s auth/sync code. No HIGH/MEDIUM findings: queries
    parameterized, rows scoped by JWT-verified `firebase_uid` (no IDOR), RS256 pinned before
    key lookup (no alg confusion), `esc()`/`normalizeState()` cover all new rendered/synced
    fields (no XSS), CORS is safe given Bearer-token (not cookie) auth. One sub-threshold
    note logged in HANDOFF.md, not a security bug (no token revocation check — accepted JWT
    tradeoff). The other sub-threshold note — `/account` delete ordering could orphan a D1
    row if `fbUser.delete()` failed — was fixed same day: `fbUser.delete()` now runs first
    (using a pre-fetched token for the fire-and-forget D1 cleanup after), so a failed
    Firebase call leaves the D1 row fully intact instead.

## v1.2 — closed 2026-07-20 (items 18-19 done)

18. ✅ **Email + password sign-in** (done 2026-07-20) — added as a second sign-in method
    alongside Google, same Firebase project, zero Worker/D1 changes. `accountSection()`
    gained an `#emailForm` (email + password fields, Log in/Create account/Forgot password)
    next to the existing Google button when logged out; logged-in view unchanged. Firebase
    console step done via MCP: `firebase_init` with `auth.providers.emailPassword: true`,
    then `firebase_deploy(only: "auth")` to provision the remote Identity Platform config
    (same gotcha Google hit in BACKLOG 15). `app.js` grew to 66,096 bytes, so the `test.js`
    budget was bumped again, 65 kB → 67 kB. `node test.js`: 4,308 green. Playwright-verified
    on local HTTP (phone viewport): register, log out, log in with the same credentials,
    forgot-password (reset email sent, confirmed by the success message), and account
    deletion — all with zero console errors. No error-code i18n map was added (matches the
    existing ponytail decision for the Google/delete flow: raw Firebase `err.message`, add
    translation only if real users hit it often).

19. ✅ **Account linking** (done 2026-07-20, requested same session after 18) — lets a couple
    share one account across both sign-in methods instead of ending up with two separate
    accounts (registering email/password on an email already used by a Google account fails
    with `auth/email-already-in-use`, Firebase's default duplicate-email prevention; there was
    previously no way to combine them). Signed-in `accountSection()` now shows a "Link Google
    sign-in" button (`fb.linkWithPopup`) when the account has no `google.com` provider, or a
    "Create password" form (`fb.updatePassword`, adds the `password` provider to a Google-only
    account per Firebase's account-linking semantics — same call recept already uses in
    production) when it has no `password` provider; neither shows once both are present. Zero
    Worker/D1 changes. `app.js` grew to 67,422 bytes, `test.js` budget bumped again, 67 kB →
    68 kB. `node test.js`: 4,308 green. Playwright-verified on local HTTP: registering a
    password account shows exactly the "Link Google sign-in" button (not the password form,
    since one already exists); clicking it opens the correct Firebase popup
    (`authType=linkViaPopup`, confirming the link flow and not a fresh sign-in); an
    unexpected `auth/credential-already-in-use` response (the automated browser's cached
    Google session was already linked to a different Firebase user) surfaced cleanly in
    `#accError` with zero console errors or crashes, which incidentally verified the failure
    path too. Test account deleted after. The Google-account → add-password direction
    (`pwForm`/`updatePassword`) was not exercised end-to-end — same limitation as BACKLOG 15's
    real Google login, needs real credentials, left for the user's own first try.

## v1.3 — closed 2026-07-20 (item 20 done)

20. ✅ **Pantry-awareness + sync merge bugfix** (done 2026-07-20, grilled via `/grilling`
    before building) — new pure `missingIngredients(drink, pantry)` shared by three pieces:
    favorite list rows show a muted "Saknar: X"/"Missing: X" badge (names when 1-2 essentials
    are missing, "Saknar 3+" beyond that), the favorite detail view mutes missing-essential
    ingredient rows (`--sd-ink-2`, deliberately not the save/skip gesture colors) alongside
    the pre-existing `favChecked` mixing-checkoff (kept fully separate, both classes coexist
    on a row), and the pantry view gained a "Nästan klara"/"Almost there" section listing
    drinks missing exactly one essential ingredient, linking via the existing `#/drink/<id>`
    deep link. Also fixed BACKLOG 15's known accepted-limitation edge case: `pullState()` used
    to unconditionally overwrite local state with server state on login, silently discarding
    pantry/favorite edits made while logged out (they're never pushed, since `save()` only
    pushes when `fbUser` is set). `pullState()` now unions `favorites`/`pantry` via a new pure
    `mergeState(local, server)` and pushes the merged result back; `settings` stays
    server-wins (scalar values, union doesn't apply). No new state keys, no Worker/D1 changes.
    `app.js` grew to 69,641 bytes, `test.js` budget bumped 68 kB → 70 kB. `node test.js`:
    4,315 green (7 new: `missingIngredients` and `mergeState` cases). Playwright-verified on
    local HTTP (phone viewport) with a seeded pantry/favorites state covering 0/1/2/3+-missing
    drinks in both SV and EN: badge text, "Nästan klara" list + working deep links, the
    `.pantry-missing` muted class (confirmed via computed style) coexisting with `.done` on
    the same row, zero console errors. The merge fix itself is unit-tested only — a live
    two-device logged-out-edit-then-login run against the real Worker needs real Firebase
    credentials (same standing limitation as BACKLOG 15/18/19's real-login gaps).

## v2 / ideas (unordered)

- Richer filter UI over existing tags: style, strength, **alcohol-free mode**.
- Search box (name + ingredient).
- Custom domain once the name is final.
- Service worker/offline (only if real-world use shows the need — recept precedent).
- Shake-to-shuffle, haptics on save (progressive enhancement only).

## Known accepted limitations

- Last-write-wins sync applies to `settings` only (v1.3, BACKLOG 20): `pantry`/`favorites`
  now merge (union) on login instead, so logged-out edits are never silently lost.
- Pantry matching is id-exact: seeding discipline on ingredient ids is what makes it work.
- No image = the drink's glass silhouette forever; acceptable for future additions and
  tracked per drink by file absence. All 92 current drinks have complete production art.
