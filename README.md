# Sipdeck

*Swipe. Save. Shake.* Browse cocktails as a swipeable card deck: swipe right to save,
left to skip, tap to flip a card over for the full recipe. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no
build, no dependencies. English + Swedish.

## Current state

The complete seed contains 93 source-audited recipes, 149 normalized ingredients and 93
optimized, visually reviewed 640×800 WebP illustrations, all under 68 kB. Every recipe
links to its specific published source; amounts, garnishes, glass and method were
rechecked against those live pages on 2026-07-23. Filters, pantry, essential-ingredient
makeability, EN/SV switching and glass-specific missing-art fallbacks are implemented.
Favorites use compact art rows and a continuous recipe view with checkmarks, clipboard
copy, published-recipe links and mobile Back navigation. Card gestures suppress native
image/text dragging and also support Arrow Left/Right. A relative web app manifest and the
finalized icon set make the app installable without a service worker. The starting page also
opens a tactile EN/SV spinning wheel that adapts 12 visible choices to a five-step mood
slider while keeping its sound, result and history visit-local. Optional Firebase login
syncs favorites and pantry through a Cloudflare Worker and D1; Firebase loads only when
account functionality is used. Bilingual privacy, local-storage, terms and
responsible-alcohol information lives in `info.html`. See `HANDOFF.md` for
the current verification state and `BACKLOG.md` for the remaining v1 work.

## Run
