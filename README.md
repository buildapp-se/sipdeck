# Sipdeck

*Swipe. Save. Shake.* Browse cocktails as a swipeable card deck: swipe right to save,
left to skip, tap to flip a card over for the full recipe. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no
build, no dependencies. English + Swedish.

## Current state

The 26-drink seed has a complete optimized illustration set. Every card art asset is a
visually reviewed 640×800 WebP under 46 kB, generated from the frozen reference workflow
in `HANDOFF.md`. Filters, pantry, essential-ingredient makeability, EN/SV switching and
glass-specific missing-art fallbacks are implemented. Favorites use compact art rows and
a continuous recipe view with checkmarks, clipboard copy, published-recipe links and
mobile Back navigation. The bottom navigation remains viewport-fixed across views; see
`BACKLOG.md` for the remaining v1 work.

## Run

```
python -m http.server   # then open http://localhost:8000
node test.js            # 1374 checks (plain node asserts, no framework)
```
